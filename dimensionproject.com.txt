%%%DREAM FROM A WHILE AGO...

I was in some kind of underground terminal. Very very high ceilings. Anyway, I was just walking through a set of automatic doors. It was so crowded that I didn't see what was past the doors... even though they were glass. What stopped me in my tracks was a small group of threatening men. I couldn't turn back now. They wanted everything in my possession. No worries, I thought, since I had maybe a handful of dollars on hand. I stood in line behind a few others to give them my belongings. Just when I thought I had narrowly escaped danger, I was shot in the head. Everything quickly faded to darkness as my body fell to the floor. It was over. But there was no afterlife. Just an eternal death sealing my fate with black.
